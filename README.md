Handy scripts usable on just about any Linux/Unix/what-have-you machine.

## ezSCP
Makes SCP a little more OP

##### Usage:
ezSCP.sh some.file /path/to/folder

To make things even easier and faster, set-up ssh keys and add
an alias pointing to this script in .profile.

Multiple ssh servers, just copy this file and give it an appropriate name,
for example:
ezSCPvps.sh for your VPS, ezSCPrpi.sh for your Raspberry Pi,
ezSCPmac.sh for your Mac.
